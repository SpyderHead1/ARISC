# ARISC
Configuration tool for the ARIS dashboard

ARISC stands for Advanced Race Information System Configurator.
It is just a little helper to read, write, backup and restore the configuration files that are used by my ARIS dashboard for SimHub.

This small tool is written in Python 3.10 and uses the Kivy 2.1.0 framework as well as some small functions from Tkinter (the file chooser for the backup and restore funtionality). So you need Python 3.10 and Kivy 2.1.0 (and my ARIS dashboard for SimHub for sure) installed to run this little program.

The file ARIS configurator.py contains almost the complete code

The file Custom.py contains some customized classes that might be useful in other projects as well

Side note - I know I could have used the kv design language but this is my first python program and the very first time I got in touch with Kivy. So bear with me =)

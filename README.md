# ARISC
Configuration tool for the ARIS dashboard

ARISC stands for Advanced Race Information System Configurator.
This small tool is written in Pythen and uses the Kivy 2.1.0 framework.
It is just a little helper to read, write, backup and restore the configuration files that are used by my ARIS dashboard for SimHub.
